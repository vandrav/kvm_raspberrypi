# KVM on a Raspberry Pi 4 with Ubuntu 22.04 LTS

This guide provides a comprehensive walkthrough for setting up KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) on a **Raspberry Pi 4** running **Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS**.

-----

## Part 1: Host (Raspberry Pi) Setup

First, we must prepare the Raspberry Pi itself.

### Hardware Requirements

  * **Platform:** Raspberry Pi 4 Model B (recommended).
  * **RAM:** 8GB is preferred for running multiple VMs, but 4GB is the minimum.
  * **Storage:** A high-speed Class 10 microSD card (32GB+) or, ideally, a **USB 3.0 SSD**.
  * **Power:** The official 5.1V/3A USB-C power supply.
  * **Cooling:** An active cooling solution (a fan) is highly recommended.

### OS Preparation & KVM Installation

1.  **Ensure a 64-bit OS:** This guide assumes you have a fresh 64-bit **Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS** installed.

2.  **Update Your System:**

    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt upgrade -y
    ```

3.  **Install KVM and Tools:**
    Install all required KVM packages, utilities, and the `cpu-checker` in one command:

    ```bash
    sudo apt install -y qemu-kvm libvirt-daemon-system libvirt-clients bridge-utils virtinst cpu-checker
    ```

    **Here's what each package does:**

      * **`qemu-kvm`**: The core emulator and KVM hypervisor backend.
      * **`libvirt-daemon-system`**: The `libvirtd` service that runs in the background to manage VMs.
      * **`libvirt-clients`**: Provides the command-line tools to interact with `libvirt`, most importantly `virsh`.
      * **`bridge-utils`**: Provides tools for creating and managing network bridges (for Method 2 networking).
      * **`virtinst`**: Provides the `virt-install` command, a powerful tool for creating new VMs.
      * **`cpu-checker`**: Provides the `kvm-ok` utility to verify your hardware setup.

### Enable Hardware Virtualization

1.  **Edit the Firmware Config:**
    On Ubuntu Server for the Pi, the config file is located at `/boot/firmware/config.txt`.

    ```bash
    sudo nano /boot/firmware/config.txt
    ```

2.  **Add KVM Flags:**
    Go to the very bottom of the file and add the following lines to enable 64-bit mode and the KVM hardware extensions:

    ```
    [all]
    arm_64bit=1
    kvm-arm=on
    ```

3.  **Reboot:**
    A reboot is **required** for these changes to take effect.

    ```bash
    sudo reboot
    ```

### Verify KVM Installation

1.  **Check KVM Status:**
    After rebooting, log in and run `kvm-ok`:

    ```bash
    kvm-ok
    ```

    You **must** see the following output:
    `INFO: /dev/kvm exists`
    `KVM acceleration can be used`

2.  **Add User to Groups:**
    Add your user account to the `libvirt` and `kvm` groups to manage VMs without using `sudo` for every command.

    ```bash
    sudo usermod -aG libvirt $USER
    sudo usermod -aG kvm $USER
    ```

3.  **Apply Group Changes:**
    You must **log out and log back in** for these new group memberships to apply.

4.  **Check `libvirt` Service:**
    Finally, check that the main `libvirt` daemon is running.

    ```bash
    systemctl status libvirtd
    ```

    You should see `active (running)` in green. You can also run `virsh list --all`, which should now execute without error.

-----

## Part 2: Network Configuration

You have two main choices for VM networking.

### Method 1: Default NAT Network (Recommended)

This is the simplest method and works out of the box. Your Pi will act as a "router" for your VMs, which will be on their own private network (e.g., `192.168.122.x`).

1.  **Check the Network:**

    ```bash
    sudo virsh net-list --all
    ```

    You should see a network named `default` that is `active`.

2.  **If it's not active:**

    ```bash
    sudo virsh net-start default
    sudo virsh net-autostart default
    ```

### Method 2: Bridged Network (Advanced)

Use this method if you want your VM to appear on your home network (e.g., `192.168.1.x`) just like any other device.

**Warning:** Ubuntu 22.04 uses `netplan`. Editing this incorrectly can lock you out of your Pi.

1.  **Find your interface name:**

    ```bash
    ip a
    ```

    Look for your main ethernet port (e.g., `eth0`).

2.  **Create a `netplan` config file:**

    ```bash
    sudo nano /etc/netplan/01-bridge.yaml
    ```

3.  **Paste this configuration.** Be careful with indentation (use spaces, not tabs). Replace `eth0` if your interface name was different.

    ```yaml
    network:
      version: 2
      renderer: networkd
      ethernets:
        eth0:
          dhcp4: no
          dhcp6: no
      bridges:
        br0:
          interfaces: [eth0]
          dhcp4: yes
          dhcp6: no
          parameters:
            stp: false
            forward-delay: 0
    ```

4.  **Apply the new configuration:**

    ```bash
    sudo netplan apply
    ```

    When you create your VM, you will specify `--network bridge=br0` instead of `--network network=default`.

-----

## Part 3: Creating a Virtual Machine

This guide covers two methods. The Installer ISO method is the most reliable.

### Method 1: The Installer ISO (Recommended)

This method is manual but bypasses all the `cloud-init` errors. You will perform a normal text-based OS installation.

1.  **Download the ARM64 Installer ISO:**

    ```bash
    mkdir -p ~/iso
    cd ~/iso
    wget https://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/22.04/release/ubuntu-22.04.5-live-server-arm64.iso
    ```

2.  **Move the ISO to the `libvirt` Directory:**
    This is critical to avoid permissions errors.

    ```bash
    sudo mv ~/iso/ubuntu-22.04.5-live-server-arm64.iso /var/lib/libvirt/images/
    ```

3.  **Run `virt-install`:**
    This command creates a new 10GB disk and attaches the ISO. It uses `--graphics none` to automatically start the text installer in your console.

    ```bash
    sudo virt-install \
    --name ubuntu-vm-01 \
    --ram 2048 \
    --vcpus 2 \
    --arch aarch64 \
    --boot uefi \
    --disk path=/var/lib/libvirt/images/ubuntu-vm-01.qcow2,size=10,format=qcow2 \
    --network network=default,model=virtio \
    --graphics none \
    --os-variant ubuntu22.04 \
    --cdrom /var/lib/libvirt/images/ubuntu-22.04.5-live-server-arm64.iso
    ```

    **Here's a breakdown of this command:**

      * **`--name`**: The unique name for your VM (e.g., `ubuntu-vm-01`).

      * **`--ram`**: Memory in MiB. We're giving it 2GB (2048) for the installation.

      * **`--vcpus`**: Number of virtual CPU cores.

      * **`--arch aarch64`**: **Critical.** Specifies the ARM 64-bit architecture.

      * **`--boot uefi`**: **Critical.** Tells the VM to use the UEFI firmware, which is required for ARM64 images.

      * **`--disk`**: Defines the virtual hard drive. We're creating a new 10GB file in the default directory.

      * **`--network`**: Connects the VM to the `default` NAT network using the high-performance `virtio` driver.

      * **`--graphics none`**: **Key.** This tells `virt-install` not to create a graphical VNC console, which forces the installer to the serial console (your terminal).

      * **`--os-variant`**: Helps `libvirt` optimize settings for this specific guest OS.

      * **`--cdrom`**: Attaches the installer ISO as a virtual CD-ROM.

      * **Note:** Your console will immediately connect. It may be **blank for up to a minute** while the ISO boots. Be patient.

4.  **Install Ubuntu Server:**
    Follow the text-based installer prompts:

      * **Network:** It should automatically detect `eth0` and get an IP from the `default` network (`192.168.122.x`).
      * **Profile Setup:** Set your desired **username** and **password**.
      * **SSH Setup:** **Press Spacebar to select [X] Install OpenSSH server.**
      * **Storage:** Use the default "Use entire disk" option.
      * Let the installation finish and select **Reboot Now**.

5.  **Log In:**
    The VM will reboot. You may need to press `Ctrl` + `]` to exit the console.

      * Find the VM's IP:
        ```bash
        sudo virsh net-dhcp-leases default
        ```
      * SSH in with the user you just created:
        ```bash
        ssh your_new_username@THE_NEW_IP_ADDRESS
        ```

-----

### Method 2: The Headless Cloud-Image (Advanced)

This method is faster but can fail if `cloud-init` is not configured perfectly.

1.  **Download the ARM64 Cloud Image:**

    ```bash
    mkdir -p ~/images
    cd ~/images
    wget https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/jammy/current/jammy-server-cloudimg-arm64.img
    ```

2.  **Install UEFI Firmware Support:**

    ```bash
    sudo apt install qemu-efi-aarch64
    ```

3.  **Create a `user-data.yaml` File:**
    This is the **critical fix** for the "No Network" error. It sets a password and forces the VM to use the `virtio` network driver.

    ```bash
    nano ~/user-data.yaml
    ```

    Paste the following, being **exact** with indentation (use spaces, not tabs).

    ```yaml
    #cloud-config
    user: ubuntu
    password: ubuntu
    chpasswd: { expire: False }
    ssh_pwauth: True
    ssh_authorized_keys:
      - ssh-rsa YOUR_SSH_PUBLIC_KEY_HERE

    network:
      version: 2
      ethernets:
        eth0:
          dhcp4: true
          match:
            driver: virtio_net
    ```

      * Replace `ssh-rsa YOUR_SSH_PUBLIC_KEY_HERE` with your *actual* public key (get it with `cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`).

4.  **Prepare the Virtual Disk:**

    ```bash
    # Copy the base image
    sudo cp ~/images/jammy-server-cloudimg-arm64.img /var/lib/libvirt/images/ubuntu-vm-01.qcow2

    # Resize it
    sudo qemu-img resize /var/lib/libvirt/images/ubuntu-vm-01.qcow2 20G
    ```

5.  **Run `virt-install`:**
    This command uses `--import` (to skip installation) and points `--cloud-init` to your config file. (Assuming your username is `w`).

    ```bash
    sudo virt-install \
    --name ubuntu-vm-01 \
    --ram 1024 \
    --vcpus 1 \
    --arch aarch64 \
    --boot uefi \
    --import \
    --disk path=/var/lib/libvirt/images/ubuntu-vm-01.qcow2,bus=virtio,format=qcow2 \
    --network network=default,model=virtio \
    --graphics none \
    --os-variant ubuntu22.04 \
    --cloud-init user-data=/home/w/user-data.yaml
    ```

    **Here's a breakdown of this command:**

      * **`--import`**: **Key.** Tells `virt-install` to skip the OS installation and boot from the *existing* disk.
      * **`--disk`**: Points to the pre-prepared cloud image disk.
      * **`--cloud-init`**: **Key.** Attaches your `user-data.yaml` file to configure the VM on its first boot.
      * (Other flags like `--name`, `--ram`, `--arch`, `--boot`, `--network`, and `--graphics` function the same as in Method 1.)

6.  **Log In:**

      * Wait 60 seconds.
      * Find the IP: `sudo virsh net-dhcp-leases default`
      * SSH in (the key *and* password `ubuntu` should work):
        ```bash
        ssh ubuntu@THE_NEW_IP_ADDRESS
        ```

-----

## Part 4: Managing Your Virtual Machine

Use the `virsh` (Virtual Shell) to control your VMs.

  * **List all VMs:**
    ```bash
    virsh list --all
    ```
  * **Start a VM:**
    ```bash
    virsh start ubuntu-vm-01
    ```
  * **Gracefully shut down a VM:**
    ```bash
    virsh shutdown ubuntu-vm-01
    ```
  * **Force-stop a VM (pull the plug):**
    ```bash
    virsh destroy ubuntu-vm-01
    ```
  * **Connect to the text console:**
    ```bash
    virsh console ubuntu-vm-01
    ```
    (To exit, press **`Ctrl`** + **`]`**)
  * **Enable auto-start on boot:**
    ```bash
    virsh autostart ubuntu-vm-01
    ```
  * **Edit a VM's settings (XML):**
    ```bash
    virsh edit ubuntu-vm-01
    ```

-----

## Part 5: Optional Performance Tuning

### 1\. Global QEMU Configuration

You can edit `/etc/libvirt/qemu.conf` for global settings.

```bash
sudo nano /etc/libvirt/qemu.conf
```

  * **`vnc_listen = "0.0.0.0"`**: Uncomment this to allow VNC access from other machines on your network (if you install a graphical VM).
  * **`memory_backing_dir = "/mnt/ssd/kvm_mem"`**: If using a fast SSD, you can point this to a directory on it.

Restart the `libvirtd` service after any changes:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart libvirtd
```

### 2\. Per-VM Configuration (`virsh edit`)

You can tune individual VMs by running `virsh edit ubuntu-vm-01`.

  * **Set CPU Cores:**

    ```xml
    <vcpu placement='static'>3</vcpu>
    ```

  * **Set Disk Cache Mode:**
    `cache='writeback'` is faster but has a small risk of data loss on sudden power failure. `cache='none'` is safer but slower.

    ```xml
    <disk type='file' device='disk'>
      <driver name='qemu' type='qcow2' cache='writeback'/>
      ...
    </disk>
    ```

### 3\. Host CPU Governor

To force your Pi to always run at max speed (better VM performance, more heat), set the CPU governor to `performance`.

```bash
# Install the tool
sudo apt install cpufreq-utils

# Set the governor
sudo cpufreq-set -g performance
```

This resets on reboot. You must create a `systemd` service to make it permanent.

-----

## Part 6: Common Troubleshooting

  * **Error: `cannot undefine domain with nvram`**

      * **Reason:** The UEFI VM has a separate NVRAM file.
      * **Fix:** Use the `--nvram` flag to delete it.
        ```bash
        sudo virsh undefine ubuntu-vm-01 --nvram
        ```

  * **Error: `Size must be specified for non existent volume`**

      * **Reason:** You used `--import` but the disk file at the specified path doesn't exist (usually a typo or missed step).
      * **Fix:** Make sure you've copied and resized the cloud image to the correct path *before* running `virt-install`.

  * **Error: `Couldn't find kernel for install tree.`**

      * **Reason:** `libvirt` doesn't have permission to read the ISO from your home directory.
      * **Fix:** Move the ISO to `/var/lib/libvirt/images/` and update the path in your command.

  * **Cloud-Image Error: `[FAILED] Failed to start Wait for Network...` or `Login incorrect`**

      * **Reason:** This means the `cloud-init` process failed on the first boot, either due to a network issue or a syntax error in your `user-data.yaml` file. It will not try again.
      * **Fix:** This VM is not recoverable. You must **destroy, undefine (with `--nvram`), and delete the disk file**, then start over from a fresh copy of the cloud image. Double-check your `user-data.yaml` for correct indentation. If it keeps failing, use the **Installer ISO (Method 1)**, which is more reliable.
